Output files explained:

-   If a student has a number at the end of their line, it means they
    competed in this division, and earned that score.
-   If a student has 0, it means they either didn’t compete in that
    division, or didn’t solve any questions.
-   If an fsuid doesn’t have a score, firstname, or last name, it
    means they completed the survey but did not show up to the contest
    (or made some sort of mistake while registering)
