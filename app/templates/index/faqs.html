				<h3>So how does this contest thing work?</h1>
				<p>The contest is a series of challenging coding questions that require critical thinking and coding know-how.<br /><br />

				Each question has a prompt consisting of flavor text and a description of the challenge. You'll get the some constraints on the input, as well as some sample input and corresponding output. From there, your team will need to work together to write code that will produce the correct output for any input we could throw at you.<br /><br />

				Responses are scored on how quickly you solved the problem relative to the contest with points deducted for each incorrect submission.<br /><br />

				<h3>How do these divisions work?</h3>
				<p>As our contest has grown almost ten-fold over the past five years, we want to allow less experienced participants
				to still be competitive.<br /><br />

				If you have not taken COP3330 (Object Oriented Programming), you
				qualify to register for the Lower Division. The Lower Division
				will have easier questions better suited for less experienced
				programmers.

				The Upper Division will cater to the highest levels of technincal talent; participants include undergraduate senors, Ph.D students, and even department faculty.
