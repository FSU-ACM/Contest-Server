			<h3>ACM's Programming Contest </h3>
			<p>
				The ACM Programming Contest is a coding competition that emphasizes
				problem solving executed in code. Students, faculty, and staff from all
				majors and colleges are welcome. The problems are ICPC style coding
				questions which are similar to questions asked by recruiters during
				technical interviews.

				<br />
				<br />

				The competition lasts 5 hours, and teams are limited to 3 members. The
				top teams from each division receive prizes, which have previously included
				things like Google Home Minis, Amazon Echoes, Raspberry Pies, Chromecasts,
				and ACM chapter t-shirts.

					<h3>So how does this contest thing work?</h1>
					<p>
						The contest is a series of challenging coding questions
						that require critical thinking and coding know-how.
						<br />
						<br />
						Each question has a prompt consisting of flavor text and a
						description of the challenge. You'll get the some
						constraints on the input, as well as some sample input and
						corresponding output. From there, your team will need to
						work together to write code that will produce the correct
						output for any input we could throw at you.
						<br />
						<br />
						Responses are scored on how quickly you solved the problem
						relative to the contest with points deducted for each
						incorrect submission.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div id="divisions" class="column is-12">
					<h3>How do these divisions work?</h3>
					<p>
						As our contest has grown almost ten-fold over the past
						five years, we want to allow less experienced participants
						to still be competitive.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are currently enrolled in COP3014 (Intro to C++) or
						COP3330 (Object Oriented Programming), you qualify to
						register for the Lower Division. The Lower Division will
						have easier questions better suited for less experienced
						programmers. The Upper Division will cater to the highest
						levels of technincal talent; participants include
						undergraduate seniors, Ph.D students, and even department
						faculty.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- <div class="column is-half">
					<h3>When and where?</h1>
						<p>
							March 31st, 8AM. This spring's venue will be the Love Building, FSU.
						</p>
				</div> -->

				<div class="column is-half">
					<h3>Who can come?</h1>
					<p>
						Everyone is welcome! Students, teachers, staff from both
						high-schools and colleges are welcome, as well as those
						not in those categories.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="column is-half">
					<h3>How much does it cost?</h1>
					<p>
						Absolutely nothing. Admission is free, and so is the food.
						Breakfast starts at 8AM, and lunch will be served close to noon.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="column is-half">
					<h3>What do I need to bring?</h1>
					<p>
						A laptop and your charger for sure. We totally recommend some
						pens or pencils to jot down your thoughts as you work to solve
						the questions.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="column is-half">
					<h3>What about these teams?</h1>
					<p>
						Teams consist of up to three people. You can work together on a
						single computer. This is the registration site!
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="column is-half">
					<h3 id="team-faq">How will I register my team?</h1>
					<p>
						You can register as a preformed team, or join one after registering
						alone. Visit the team page after you log in to see more.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="column is-half">
					<h3>How much experience do I need?</h1>
					<p>
						We recommend some early programming experience in one of our
						supported languages: C/C++, Java, Python, Perl, C#, and Javascript.
						You'll have access to official language documentation, but that's it.
						No Google, no StackOverflow.
					</p>
				</div>

					<h3>Wait, what about...?</h1>
